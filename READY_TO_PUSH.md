## 📤 What WILL Be Pushed (Safe Files Only)

### Template Files (No Real Credentials):
- ✓ `gads-sim-backend/config.yaml.example` - Placeholder template
- ✓ `gads-sim-backend/env.example` - Placeholder template
- ✓ `gads-sim-frontend/env.example` - Placeholder template

### Documentation:
- ✓ `README.md` - Project overview
- ✓ `SECURITY.md` - Security guidelines
- ✓ `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Setup instructions
- ✓ `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Deployment guide
- ✓ All other documentation files

### Source Code:
- ✓ All Python and TypeScript/JavaScript files
- ✓ Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- ✓ No credentials in source code

---

## 🎯 How It Works for Your Users

### Your Setup (Private):
1. **Your Local Machine** → Has `config.yaml` with real credentials
2. **Your Production Server** → Will have `config.yaml` with real credentials
3. **GitHub Repository** → Will NOT have `config.yaml` (ignored)

### User Experience:
1. User accesses your **deployed application**
2. Application uses **YOUR Google Ads API** and **YOUR Gemini API**
3. User doesn't need their own API credentials
4. Everything works seamlessly!

### For Team Members/Developers:
1. They clone the repository (no credentials included)
2. You send them the credential files separately (email, secure chat, etc.)
3. They place `config.yaml` and `.env` files in correct locations
4. They can run the app locally

## ✅ Final Verification Results

### Test 1: Credential Files Check ✓
```
gads-sim-backend/config.yaml     → IGNORED ✓
gads-sim-backend/.env            → IGNORED ✓
gads-sim-frontend/.env.local     → IGNORED ✓
.env                             → IGNORED ✓
```

### Test 2: Staged Files Check ✓
```
✅ NO credential files found in staged changes
✅ Only safe template files and source code will be pushed
```

### Test 3: Secret Search ✓
```
✅ No exposed secrets found in staged files
```

## 🚀 You're Ready to Push!

Run these commands to push to GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Review what will be committed
git status

# 2. Commit all changes
git commit -m "Initial commit - Google Ads Campaign Simulator"

# 3. Create a new repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## 📋 Post-Push Checklist

After pushing to GitHub:

### 1. Verify on GitHub ✓
- Open your repository on GitHub
- Check that `config.yaml` is NOT visible
- Check that `.env` files are NOT visible
- Confirm only template files (`*.example`) are present

### 2. Keep Local Backups ✓
```bash
# Create a backup folder outside the repository
mkdir ~/google-ads-sim-credentials-backup

# Copy credential files
cp gads-sim-backend/config.yaml ~/google-ads-sim-credentials-backup/
cp gads-sim-backend/.env ~/google-ads-sim-credentials-backup/
cp gads-sim-frontend/.env.local ~/google-ads-sim-credentials-backup/
```

### 3. Document for Your Team ✓
Create a secure document with instructions for new team members on where to get credential files.

## 🔄 Updating Your Project

When you make changes to your code (not credentials):

```bash
# Make your changes to source files
# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push

# Your credentials remain on your machine and won't be pushed
```

When you need to update credentials:

```bash
# Edit config.yaml or .env locally
# Git will automatically ignore these changes
# No git commands needed!

# Update credentials on production server manually
```

---

## 🆘 Emergency: If Credentials Are Accidentally Pushed

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Rotate ALL credentials immediately**:
   - Get new Google Ads API credentials from Google Cloud Console
   - Get new Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
   - Generate new NextAuth secret
   - Change database password

2. **Remove from GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Delete repository and create new one (easiest)
   # Option 2: Use git filter-branch (advanced)
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch gads-sim-backend/config.yaml" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. **Monitor for unauthorized usage**:
   - Check Google Ads API usage logs
   - Check Gemini API usage logs
   - Review application access logs
